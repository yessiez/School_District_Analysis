# School_District_Analysis
In Module 4, you will begin working with some powerful tools as you assist the Chief Data Scientist for the PyCity School District. You’ll use an open-source distribution software called Anaconda and the Jupyter Notebook to analyze data. You’ll be helping the school board and superintendent make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities based on the standardized test scores and current school funding.


# Overview of the School District Analysis: 
## Background
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. 

## Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis was to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact and repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

Recreate the following metrics:
1. The district summary
2. The school summary
3. The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
4. The average math score for each grade level from each school
5. The average reading score for each grade level from each school
6. The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type

### PyCity School District Analysis:
- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - School performance based on the budget per student
  - School performance based on the school size 
  - School performance based on the type of school


# Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data

- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type

# Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
There is a statement summarizing four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced (5 pt).
