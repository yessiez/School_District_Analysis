# School_District_Analysis
In Module 4, you will begin working with some powerful tools as you assist the Chief Data Scientist for the PyCity School District. You’ll use an open-source distribution software called Anaconda and the Jupyter Notebook to analyze data. You’ll be helping the school board and superintendent make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities based on the standardized test scores and current school funding.


## Overview of the School District Analysis: 
### Background
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. 

### Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis was to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact and repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

Recreate the following metrics:
1. The district summary
2. The school summary
3. The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
4. The average math score for each grade level from each school
5. The average reading score for each grade level from each school
6. The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type
